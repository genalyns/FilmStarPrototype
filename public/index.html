      down the page. 
    I decided to change this as I thought it was unnecessary to add and those that making a nice layout for the aim of my website would be more
    a more efficient use of space.

            However, For the genre selection, I had decided to remove the genre images that would have 
            automatically been selected when choosing the desired genre. 
            I had realised that despite movies being in the same genre, the images selected do not represent 
            the actual movie that would have been written in and that it would have not added any substance to the website.
            Therefore having no purpose in an automatic genre image
