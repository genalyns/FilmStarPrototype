After feedback from A2, I had drastically changed my website's designs and functionality from what I had originally intended it to look like.

Changes I made:  
- Scope of the website:
    I had originally wanted to make my website be able to track finished and unfinished movies. However, after reiterating the aim of my website, I realised that adding already watched movies was something I did not want users to track on the site. 
    This being said, I had chosen to only track unfinished movies, where the user would still be able to add the movie name, genre, opinins, date released and time need to complete in minutes. With movie input automatically providing the day and time with the timezone of when the movie was added. 

- Design/ layout of website:
    From my A2 feedback, tutor had pointed out that I had poorly incorporated modern UI design trends in my original design with some of my reasoning not matching up with my design choices. After viewing websites I was on daily, such as Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter I had noticed that all these sites had a black/dark layout which I wanted to implement into my website. 

    The colour palette had completely changed, from being pink and green to black, white, red and yellow which I thought matched a lot better with a darker aesthethic, due to my aim being that users use it during the evening after work or school. As well as matching other famous streaming platforms like Netflix, which the users could be switching from to track their unfinished movies. 

    

- Movie opinion row:
    With the removal of the idea of adding finished movies, I had originally wanted to make a feature where the user could rate the movie out of 5 stars through a drop down menu. However, I wanted to implement something similar to my current idea, being that the user can add a long or short opinion on the movie so far to decide whether or not to finish the movie.

    I also thought adding this feature gave my website purpose as famous streaming platforms already view where the user is up to. 


- Progress wheel:
    I wanted to add a progress wheel, that had a string input where it would automatically provide a percentage of how far into the movie the user is. 
    After my A2 feedback, the progress wheel seemed confusing and would require the user to change an existing movie in the list which was not the requirements.



Improvements I would make: 
    With enough time and skill, adding a button that added existing movies in the unfinished list to be added to a seperate finished movie list or even the progress wheel idea.
